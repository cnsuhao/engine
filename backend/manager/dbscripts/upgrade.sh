# Upgrade script wrapper for handling each Schema or data change.
# Each upgrade change should be in a separate file formatted  by MM_mm_nnnn_[Name].sql
# where:
#   MM  indicates Major Version number
#   mm indicates Minor Version number
#   nnnn are numbers starting from 0010, each having an offset of 10 from previous script
#   (i.e 0010 0020 ....)
#   [Name] is a short descriptive name for the script.
#   All changes should be located under the upgrade/ directory
#
#   When using -f <version> all scripts with version greater than the given one will
#   be re-executed , for example -f 0300100 will execute all scripts from 03000110
#   and forth
# Since all views $ SP are dropped before upgrade and restored after all upgrade
# script were executed. We may have cases in which we need to run some helper
# functions before the upgrade script runs.
# In such a case and when those functions can not be put in the common_sp.sql
# because they are dependant on objects created by an upgrade script, we can put
# one or several lines at the begining of our upgrade file:
# --#source <sql_file_name>_sp.sql
# for example , putting in an upgrade script
# --#source myfunctions_sp.sql
# will run myfunctions_sp.sql before the upgrade script is executed.
#
# Each script must be re-entrant (i.e. each script checks if each step is needed
# to be executed or not, so we can run the same script many times without any
# problems)
