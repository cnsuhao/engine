# Use this if you want to enable remote debugging of the engine java virtual
# machine (useful mainly for developers):
#
#   ENGINE_DEBUG_ADDRESS=ovirt.example.com:8787
#
# The address and port should be reachable from your debugger, so using
# localhost is not good unless you are running the engine and the debugger in
# the same machine.

# Change following to true if you want to enable garbage collection debug
# information (will be sent to the console.log file):

#
# Extra system properties to be added to the java virtual machine
# of the engine. Properties can be specified using the typical
# java syntax:
#
#   -Dmy.param=my.value
#   -Dmy.flag
#
# If the -D prefix is not used it will be automatically added, so
# the following is also valid:
#
#   my.param=my.value
#   my.flag
#
# If several properties need to be specified they should all go in
# the same line and separated by spaces:
#
#   -Dmy.param=my.value -Dmy.flag -Dyour.param=your.value

#
